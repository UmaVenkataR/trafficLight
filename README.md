### Traffic Control System

A modern, interactive traffic light simulation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases a visually appealing traffic light interface with a smooth, functional light cycle and timer system.

#### Features
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, centered layout with a sleek dark theme and gradient background.
- **Animated Traffic Lights**: Three circular lights (Red, Yellow, Green) with glow effects and opacity transitions.
- **Timer Display**: Real-time countdown for each light phase (Green: 5s, Yellow: 3s, Red: 5s).
- **Control Buttons**: Start, Stop, and Reset functionality to manage the traffic light cycle.
- **Emoji Indicators**: Fun emoji representations for each light state (‚ù§Ô∏è for Red, üëç for Yellow, üòä for Green).

#### Technical Highlights
- **CSS Styling**: Utilizes flexbox for layout, CSS transitions for smooth animations, and box-shadow for depth.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Implements a robust state management system with proper interval cleanup and synchronized timing.
- **Modular Code**: Functions separated for light control, timer management, and cycle logic.

#### How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click "Start Signal" to begin the automated light cycle.
3. Use "Stop Signal" to pause and "Reset Signal" to return to the initial state.

#### Purpose
Created as a demonstration of front-end development skills, combining aesthetic design with functional programming. Ideal for learning about DOM manipulation, event handling, and timing in JavaScript.
